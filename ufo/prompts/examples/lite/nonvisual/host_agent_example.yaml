    My name is Zac. Please send a email to jack@outlook.com to thanks his contribution on the open source.
  Response: 
    Observation: |-
      I observe that the outlook application is available from the control item list, with the title of 'Mail - Outlook - Zac'. I can see a list of emails in the application.
    Thought: |-
      The user request can be solely complete on the outlook application. I need to open the outlook application for the current sub-task. If successful, no further sub-tasks are needed.
    CurrentSubtask: |- 
      Compose an email to send to Jack (jack@outlook.com) to thank him for his contribution to the open source project on the outlook application, using the name Zac.
    Message:
      - (1) The name of the sender is Zac.
      - (2) The email composed should be detailed and professional.

      The previous sub-task that extracts the text from the 'framework.docx' is completed. Now, I need to switch to the image of 'framework.png' to complete the next sub-task and then summarize them to send the message to Tom on Teams.
    CurrentSubtask: |-
