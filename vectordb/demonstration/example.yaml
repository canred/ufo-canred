  example:
    Observation: The screenshot shows the Microsoft Outlook application with an email
      composition window open. The 'To' field is empty, and no email address has been
      entered. The subject and body of the email are also blank. The last action taken
      was opening the Outlook application.
    Thought: Based on the screenshot, the first step is to input the email address
      example@gmail.com into the 'To' field.
    ControlLabel: '2'
    ControlText: ''
    Function: SetText
    Args:
      text: example@gmail.com
    Status: CONTINUE
    Plan: '(1) Input the email address example@gmail.com into the ''To'' field.

      (2) Input the subject of the email. Since the user request is to say hello,
      the subject can be ''Hello''.

      (3) Input the content of the email. The content should be a friendly greeting,
      such as ''Hi there,\nJust wanted to drop a quick note to say hello!\nBest regards.''

      (4) Click the Send button to send the email.'
    Comment: The user has provided the email address and the content to be sent. The
      trajectory shows that the user began to input an incorrect email and content,
      which does not match the user request. I will correct this by inputting the
      right email address and content.
  Tips: '- Ensure the email address is entered correctly in the ''To'' field.

    - Use a clear and concise subject for the email.

    - Draft the email content in a friendly and professional tone.

    - Review the email before sending to avoid any mistakes.'
  request: send email to example@gmail.com and say hello
