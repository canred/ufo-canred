# Creating Your AppAgent

UFO provides a flexible framework and SDK for application developers to empower their applications with AI capabilities by wrapping them into an `AppAgent`. By creating an `AppAgent`, you can leverage the power of UFO to interact with your application and automate tasks.

To create an `AppAgent`, you can provide the following components:

| Component | Description | Usage Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Help Documents](./help_document_provision.md) | The help documents for the application to guide the `AppAgent` in executing tasks. | [Learning from Help Documents](../advanced_usage/reinforce_appagent/learning_from_help_document.md) |
| [User Demonstrations](./demonstration_provision.md) | The user demonstrations for the application to guide the `AppAgent` in executing tasks. | [Learning from User Demonstrations](../advanced_usage/reinforce_appagent/learning_from_demonstration.md) |
| [Native API Wrappers](./warpping_app_native_api.md) | The native API wrappers for the application to interact with the application. | [Automator](../automator/overview.md) |
