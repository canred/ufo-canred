## For Users
If you are a user of UFO, and want to use it to automate your tasks on Windows, you can refer to [User Configuration](../configurations/user_configuration.md) to set up your environment and start using UFO.
For instance, except for configuring the `HOST_AGENT` and `APP_AGENT`, you can also configure the LLM parameters and RAG parameters in the `config.yaml` file to enhance the UFO agent with additional knowledge sources.


## For Developers
If you are a developer who wants to contribute to UFO, you can take a look at the [Developer Configuration](../configurations/developer_configuration.md) to explore the development environment setup and the development workflow.

You can also refer to the [Project Structure](../project_directory_structure.md) to understand the project structure and the role of each component in UFO, and use the rest of the documentation to understand the architecture and design of UFO. Taking a look at the [Session](../modules/session.md) and [Round](../modules/round.md) can help you understand the core logic of UFO.

For debugging and testing, it is recommended to check the log files in the `ufo/logs` directory to track the execution of UFO and identify any issues that may arise.
